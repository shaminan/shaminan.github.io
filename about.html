					<p>I'm Shannon!  When I'm not creating projects, I am busy momming to my two kids, Rory (12) and Ryder (10), and hanging with my hubby of 23 years, Darren.  Our family loves advenutres of any kind, and currently reside in the upper hills of Duvall, WA.
					<p>In my previous life, before kids, I was a middle school PE/Health teacher.  When I decided to stay home to raise my kiddos, I wanted to find something that would branch me out beyond laundry and dishes each day.  On a whim, I bought a Cricut....and the rest is history.</p>
					<p>As for the quilting...well...when I was dating my husband, Darren, his mom loved to quilt.  I decided we needed to bond over something, so I asked her to teach me.  Dozens of quilts later, we still love to get together and make quilting masterpieces!</p>
